Week 5
1. What is the “size” (i.e., slope) of this relationship? Interpret the slope in plain language. Does it match your plot? 
Mother: 0.37757 
The slope matches my plot. This means that for every year, there will be a 0.38 increase in maternal DNMs 

2. Is the relationship significant? How do you know? Explain the p-value in plain but precise language.
p-value: 2e-16 
The relationship is significant becuase the p value is extremely low. That means that it is very  unilikely that this relationship observed occurred due to random chance. 

2.4 Use the paternal regression model to predict the expected number of paternal DNMs for a father of age 50.5. 
78.69546 

2.6
data:  joined_df$DNM_count_father and joined_df$DNM_count_mother
t = 61.609, df = 395, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 37.98284 40.48685
sample estimates:
mean difference 
       39.23485 
1. What is the “size” of this relationship (i.e., the average difference in counts of maternal and paternal DNMs)? Interpret the difference in plain language. Does it match your plot? 2. Is the relationship significant? How do you know? Explain the p-value in plain but precise language.
